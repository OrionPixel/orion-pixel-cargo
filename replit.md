## Overview

This is a full-stack cargo/logistics management platform built with Express.js backend and React frontend. The application provides comprehensive tracking, booking, and fleet management capabilities for transportation and logistics companies. It uses a modern tech stack with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and real-time GPS tracking features.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with conventional HTTP methods
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session management
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket server for GPS tracking

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via Neon serverless)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations and type generation
- **Key Tables**: users, bookings, vehicles, warehouses, tracking_events, live_tracking
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session store for authentication

## Key Components

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based authentication using Passport.js
- Role-based access control (transporter, distributor, warehouse, admin, office)
- Password hashing with both bcrypt (office accounts) and scrypt (regular users)
- Protected routes with middleware validation

### Booking Management
- Multi-type booking system (FTL, LTL, part_load)
- Dynamic pricing calculation with GST
- Payment tracking and status management
- Barcode and QR code generation for shipments

### Vehicle & Fleet Management
- Vehicle registration and status tracking
- GPS device integration and management
- Real-time location monitoring
- Maintenance and availability tracking

### GPS & Tracking System
- WebSocket-based real-time GPS data streaming
- Support for hardware GPS trackers and mobile apps
- Route monitoring and ETA calculations
- Live tracking visualization

### Warehouse Operations

- PDF export functionality
- Real-time analytics with charts

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in via form → Passport.js validates → Session created → User data cached
2. **Booking Creation**: Form submission → Validation → Database insert → Tracking number generation → Real-time updates
3. **GPS Tracking**: Hardware devices → WebSocket connection → Location updates → Database storage → Client updates
4. **Real-time Updates**: Server events → WebSocket broadcast → Client state updates → UI refresh

## External Dependencies
